    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A stuffed Pork Loin filled with a mixture of pureed Garlic and Rosemary. Topped with crispy Pancetta and a White Wine sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 2-1/2 lb Pork</li>
        <li>6-8 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>2 Springs of Fresh Rosemary</li>
        <li>1/2 Bunch of Italian Parsley</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>4 oz of Thinly Sliced Pancetta</li>
        <li>2 cups of White Wine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of Water</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a food processor or by hand, puree the Garlic, Rosemary leaves, Parsley, 2 tbsp of Olive Oil, Salt, and Pepper until smooth.</li>
        <li>Slice the Pork Loin lengthwise on one side. Be sure not to cut all the way through.</li>
        <li>Season the inside of the pork with Salt and Pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread the Garlic puree mixture evenly all over the inside of the Pork Loin leaving a 1" border on one side.</li>
        <li>Roll up the Pork Loin and cover the top with Pancetta. Tie sturdy with kitchen twine and place in a roasting rack. Allow the pork to come to room temperature for approximately 15 minutes while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>After the oven is preheated, add the Water and White Wine to the bottom of the roasting dish.</li>
        <li>Cook for about 1 hour and 15 minutes or more, until the internal temperature of the Pork reaches 155 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Allow the Pork to rest for 15 minutes. Skim off the fat from the roasting pan and discard.</li>
        <li>To serve, slice the pork into thick slices and top with the juices from the Wine mixture. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
